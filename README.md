## Alderaanians - IABC Regina Website Rebuild


## Project Background

This project is to design a new website for IABC Regina. IABC Regina is a chapter of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC). IABC is an organization comprised of professional communicators who join to develop skills, share resources, take part in events and create connections. Professional communicators are trained writers who are driven by truth and ethics in their releases and publications.

Specifically, for the IABC Regina chapter, their website is in need of a revamp. It is clustered and confusing with too much going on and too little at the same time. Their website is visited by prospective members and existing members of the chapter and should be focused on their needs and wants. 

## Business Need/Opportunity

IABC Regina's current website is messy and outdated. It is frustrating to use and will deter their already small audience from wanting to use it. Our goal is to change this by creating a sleek, streamlined website using WordPress. 

### Wants

-   Engagement Paths - Vlogs/Blogs
-   News section w/ user submissions
-   Login/register system
-   Aesthetically pleasing design

### Needs
-   Simplistic, clean navigation
-   Built-in events and payment system
-   Updated careers and job postings section
-   Linking to IABC International when possible
-   An easy to use and configure backend

During our interview/meeting with them on February 8th, we clarified their needs and wants and presented questions on various topics including security and a payment system. We discussed with them the security and admin hours required to setup events and payment submission in comparison to Eventbrite. It seems to us that Eventbrite is the best alternative going forward as it can even be installed directly on a webpage in WordPress with a plugin.


## **NorthStar & Carryover Customers**

The NorthStar customers will be professional communicators looking to gain connections, get accredited, attend events, mentorships, volunteer and socialize with like-minded professionals.

Carryover customers will be limited if not non-existent as the website is niche. Relevancy and consumer base will not change much with an updated website. It will still be professional communicators, primarily in the Regina area, that are interested in the content. A new website may bring in more of them, but we can’t see how it would bring in any customers.

## **Project Assumptions (e.g., WordPress)**

It is assumed that this website will be designed using WordPress and it has been mentioned that WordPress Jetpack is a good package to look at.

External connections to API’s such as IABC International content do not appear to be possible.

No other clear assumptions at the moment. Any other assumptions made during the development process will be made with the requirements of the customers in mind.



## **Project Constraints**

The main constraints of this project are budget, expertise, time and IABC content.

The budget of this website is limited and subscription services or monthly payments from tools used in the design and functionality of the website should be kept to a minimum. The only area that will definitely require a payment is payment processing for events and memberships.

The expertise in our group with building projects for customers and creating websites will act as a constraint on the final project. If we had more expertise in both areas, it would be easier to fulfill both the customers needs and wants, as well as determine what exactly these are. It is still possible to do this with our current skillset, however it will be more of a learning experience and about adapting as we get feedback.

The time that we have for this project is limited. In addition, we are also taking other classes which require the same amount of time and effort. 

The current website displays upcoming events and news on the homepage. This is empty at the moment and is directly linked to the pandemic and a lack of IABC content. A challenge for this project will be building a website that can display content when there is some upcoming while also looking clean and concise when there is not any upcoming content. At the same time, keeping excess webpages and categories related to different categories of information will be important. The current website does not have much content, but has tons of pages as each topic is segmented into its own group. This will have to be remedied and kept in mind.
